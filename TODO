  - improve sending of 'have' to server

  - proper capabilities negotiation

  - figure out a more efficient method of determining if the cache contains
    objects.  Right now, the proxy invokes one `git rev-list' process for each
    SHA1 that it needs to check.  It seems there should be a more efficient
    method (other than opening/reading pack files ourselves).

  - handle .keep files correctly

  - monitor state, dump it by SIGHUP etc.

  - proper logging

  - create git cache dir

  - robustness: retry on server problems

  - tests!

  - fix up truncated strings during clone, e.g.
