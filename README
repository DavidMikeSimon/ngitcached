ngitcached - a caching git proxy
================================

*** THIS IS PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE ***
It is not suitable for use in production.

ngitcached is a git proxy with two primary goals:

  - speed up repeated clones/fetches of the same git objects from
    multiple clients.

  - provide a stable interface to flaky git servers.
